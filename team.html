					Our culture is one of our unique value propositions and we can do amazing things because of it. We are passionate about technology
					and working together to achieve something great. Our R&D is located in London which is comfortable for our clients who
					are from Europe. We believe the process of building great software can be as rewarding as the final product and we pour
					our passion into every step of the process. Our team has worked with diffenet largest telecommunications companies,

							<h1>Our Skills</h1>
							<p>We are making bright products, not just coding them</p>
						</header>
						<p class="dev_content ">
							We prefer working with people who are able to solve problems, not to repeat the same solutions again and again from one project
							to another. As a simple and fast task to review our developer we use a classic problem of sorting an array of integers.
							We give a candidate a piece of paper and a pen. Many people guess it foolish to write the code on a sheet at the interview
							but it's actually not. Looking at the written solution we can understand a lot than after a thorough code review.
							It is not required to write the most effective algorithm and he is given not more than 15 minutes.
						</p>
						<p class="dev_content ">
							Software development changes faster than any other industry and staying on top of emerging tools, frameworks and methodologies
							is essential in delivering great products. We use our own libraries, frameworks and approaches we've been creating
							for years and even share them with the industry. It helps us to deeply understand the industry (Mobile apps development,
							VR/AR development, whatever) and make sure that we are at the top of the list!

							<h1>How we work</h1>
							<p>We are a team of Agile-evangelists who believe in transparency</p>
						</header>
						<p class="dev_content ">
							We use Scrum approach during the development process which helps us clearly understand where we are. On another hand, our
							client who is actually is a Product Owner is the main person who can manage his budget, list of features and vision
							of his product right away! Our engineers are deeply involved in the concept and take part in all the Scrum-events,
							teach each other but sometimes hate the Retrospectives:)
						</p>
						<p class="dev_content ">
							We use tools like JIRa and Slack for project management and client communication. If you want to be in control of everything
							and to manage the work on your project yourself, this is the best option. We form a team of the most professional
							specialists and they start working on the project after your approval. The development goes on according to Agile
							practices and the developers concentrate on your project only. By combining these processes, skills and tools we have
							built a great reputation of delivering incredible software and thrilling our clients
