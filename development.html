						<h1>Web Development</h1>
						<p class="dev_content">
							We are masters of web development using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. We design web experiences "mobile first" because we understand
							most web traffic today comes from a mobile device. You'll be amazed at what mobile web can do!
						</p>
						<p class="dev_content">
							Web development tools change faster than any other area of software development and we stay very focused on every new tool,
							framework and methodology that emerges. This deep focus and experience in web development allows us to select the
							perfect development tools and frameworks to use for a given project. Not every web project is the same and our engineers
							are a part of the delivery process from the beginning so we can understand the requirements and user stories before
							selecting a tech stack. Selecting the right tech stack and 3rd parties tools is an essential part of our development
							process and we believe our ability to select the right tool for the right job is what gives us an incredible edge
							in delivering state of the art software with amazing speed and precision.

						<h1>Software for POS systems</h1>
						<p class="dev_content">
							We provide complex software solutions for self-service POS systems and terminals, usually called as information kiosks with
							specific functionality which enables the user to perform certain transactions independently. The main advantage is
							that these devices offer cash- or cashless payment functionality.

						</p>
						<p class="dev_content">
							By using POS software, employees can find information about products, create quick orders, accept payments, and deliver receipts
							in an expeditious manner. This helps employees perform more transactions in less time while customers benefit from
							shorter waiting times at checkout. POS software solutions can also be used to provide information to customers on
							product availability, pricing, etc.
