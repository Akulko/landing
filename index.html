								<h2>The best and the brightest</h2>
								<p>Our culture is one of our unique value propositions and we can do amazing things because of it. We are passionate
									about technology and working together to achieve something great. Our R&D is located in London which is comfortable
									for our clients who are from Europe. We believe the process of building great software can be as rewarding as the
									final product and we pour our passion into every step of the process. Our team has worked with diffenet largest
									telecommunications companies, real estate companies and startups from the United Kingdom, Canada and the U.S.</p>

						<h3>Our Skills</h3>

							<div class="content">
								<h2>We are making bright products, not just coding them</h2>
								<p>We prefer working with people who are able to solve problems, not to repeat the same solutions again and again from
									one project to another. As a simple and fast task to review our developer we use a classic problem of sorting an
									array of integers. We give a candidate a piece of paper and a pen. Many people guess it foolish to write the code
									on a sheet at the interview but it's actually not. Looking at the written solution we can understand a lot than
									after a thorough code review. It is not required to write the most effective algorithm and he is given not more
									than 15 minutes.</p>

						<h3>How we work</h3>
						<div class="split reversed">
							<div class="content">
								<h2>We are a team of Agile-evangelists who believe in transparency</h2>
								<p>We use Scrum approach during the development process which helps us clearly understand where we are. On another hand,
									our client who is actually is a Product Owner is the main person who can manage his budget, list of features and
									vision of his product right away! Our engineers are deeply involved in the concept and take part in all the Scrum-events,
									teach each other but sometimes hate the Retrospectives:)</p>
